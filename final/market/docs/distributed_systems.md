# Distributed Systems in Django: Postgres and Cassandra

In this document, we will explore how to implement a distributed system using **PostgreSQL** and **Cassandra** for an e-commerce Django platform. Specifically, we will focus on integrating **PostgreSQL** for general data models and **Cassandra** for the **Payments** system, which is optimized for high-write, high-volume operations, and large datasets.

## Introduction to Distributed Systems

A **distributed system** is a system that consists of multiple components located on different machines, communicating over a network. In the context of Django, we can build a distributed system that uses multiple databases or services to handle specific tasks. For example:

- **PostgreSQL**: Used for storing core transactional data (products, users, orders, etc.).
- **Cassandra**: Used for storing high-volume data that requires horizontal scaling and fast writes (payments).

In our use case, PostgreSQL handles traditional relational data, and Cassandra is used to handle high-throughput, low-latency transactions for payments.

## Using PostgreSQL for General Models

### Why PostgreSQL?

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that is ideal for handling complex queries, ACID-compliant transactions, and complex relationships. It is used for the core of the system because of its robustness in handling relationships and transactional data.

### Setup in Django

To set up PostgreSQL in Django, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install psycopg2
```
## Using Cassandra for Payments
Why Cassandra?
Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database that is optimized for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers without a single point of failure. It is ideal for use cases where data is written often and read less frequently, such as storing transaction logs, payment records, or clickstreams.

Setup in Django with Cassandra
To integrate Cassandra with Django, you need to use a third-party library, such as django-cassandra-engine. This allows Django to interact with Cassandra, though the setup and configuration are different from traditional relational databases.

First, install the Cassandra engine:

```bash
pip install django-cassandra-engine
```
In your settings.py:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django_cassandra_engine.models',
        'NAME': 'your_cassandra_keyspace',
        'HOST': 'your_cassandra_host',
        'PORT': 9042,
        'USER': 'your_cassandra_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_cassandra_password',
    }
}
```
## Models in Cassandra
Cassandra stores data in tables, but without the need for joins or complex relationships. You can define a simple schema for storing payment transactions, for example:

**Example:**
```python
from cassandra.cqlengine import columns
from django_cassandra_engine.models import DjangoCassandraModel

class Payment(DjangoCassandraModel):
    payment_id = columns.UUID(primary_key=True)
    user_id = columns.UUID()
    order_id = columns.UUID()
    amount = columns.Decimal()
    status = columns.Text()
    timestamp = columns.DateTime()

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'payments'
```
## Challenges and Solutions
### 4.1 Consistency vs. Availability in Distributed Systems
In a distributed system, especially when integrating PostgreSQL (ACID-compliant) and Cassandra (eventual consistency), you may face challenges with consistency and availability.

PostgreSQL guarantees strong consistency, meaning all transactions are ACID-compliant.
Cassandra, on the other hand, sacrifices consistency for availability and partition tolerance, following the AP principle of the CAP theorem.
#### Solution:
Ensure that only data that does not require strong consistency (like payment records) is stored in Cassandra, while PostgreSQL should be used for relational and transactional data where consistency is critical.

### 4.2 Managing Data Across Two Databases
Since PostgreSQL and Cassandra serve different purposes, managing data consistency between them can be complex. For example, when a payment is made, you may want to store the transaction in Cassandra and update the order status in PostgreSQL.

#### Solution: 
Use a two-phase commit or event-driven architecture with messaging queues (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) to ensure that the data between the two databases remains consistent.

## Best Practices
### 5.1 Shard Data in Cassandra
Cassandra is optimized for horizontal scaling, so ensure you shard data appropriately. For example, partitioning payment data by payment type or user region can help distribute the load across different nodes in the Cassandra cluster.

### 5.2 Monitor and Scale Cassandra Cluster
Cassandra handles large volumes of writes, but monitoring its health is crucial. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your Cassandra cluster and scale it horizontally when needed.

### 5.3 Cache Frequently Accessed Data
While Cassandra is optimized for fast writes, you may want to cache frequently read data (like product details or user profiles) in a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load.

### 5.4 Use Asynchronous Writes for Payments
Since Cassandra excels at handling high-throughput writes, you can use asynchronous writes for payment processing. This can help improve the performance of the system by not blocking the user while the payment transaction is being written to Cassandra.

## Conclusion
Implementing a distributed system using PostgreSQL for general e-commerce data and Cassandra for high-volume payment data provides a powerful solution for scaling your Django-based e-commerce platform. PostgreSQL handles complex queries and transactions, while Cassandra provides a highly available and scalable solution for payments. By combining both, you can build a robust system capable of handling high traffic and large amounts of data efficiently.

By following best practices like sharding, caching, and monitoring, you can ensure that your distributed system remains performant and reliable even as it scales.
