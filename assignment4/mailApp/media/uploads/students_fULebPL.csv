Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.

Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.

Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.

Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.

Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.

Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.

Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.

Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.

Draco,Malfoy ManorExercise 3: Combined Application

Objective: Create a Django application that integrates asynchronous processing and adheres to security best practices while handling a high load.

Tasks:

Setup:

Follow the setup steps from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to configure Celery and security measures.

Application Design:

Design an application where users can submit large datasets (e.g., CSV uploads).

Process these uploads asynchronously using Celery and validate the data securely.

Progress Tracking:

Implement a progress tracking system for the user to see the status of their upload and processing. This can be done using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling.

Secure File Handling:

Ensure that uploaded files are scanned for malware and only allow certain file types.

Use Django’s storage backends to store uploaded files securely.

High Load Considerations:

Implement caching (using Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

Optimize database queries to ensure efficiency during high traffic.

Testing:

Write unit tests for all features, especially focusing on security aspects and concurrent processing scenarios.

Perform load testing on your application to ensure it behaves correctly under stress.
